# Candy Box Mobile

Candy Box is an awesome web game which you can [play here](https://candybox2.github.io/).  
This project is an attempt to rebuild this game for release as a mobile app.  
It is currenly in early development and is not yet on the app stores.

## Technologies

The planned tech stack is to use React with Styled Components, Redux, Saga for the game.  
Then deploy it to the app stores with Capacitor.

## Contributing
